                                            You can configure one of the computers as a Key Management Service (KMS) host and activate the KMS host by phone.  The other computers in the isolated network can then activate using the KMS host.<br>Installing a KMS host key on a computer running Windows 10 allows you to activate other computers running Windows 10 against this KMS host and earlier versions of the client operating system, such as Windows 8.1 or Windows 7. Clients locate the KMS server by using resource records in DNS, so some configuration of DNS may be required. This scenario can be beneficial if your organization uses volume activation for clients and MAK-based activation for a smaller number of servers. To enable KMS functionality, a KMS key is installed on a KMS host; then, the host is activated over the Internet or by phone using<br>Microsoft's activation services.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/volume-activation/activate-using-key-management-service-vamt

                                            Explanation -<br>Windows Hello facial recognition requires an infrared (IR) camera.  If your device does not have an infrared camera (or any other biometric device such as a fingerprint scanner), you will see the message shown in the exhibit. The question states that Device Manager shows all hardware is working properly.  Therefore, it is not the case that the computer has an IR camera but it isn't working properly.  The problem must be that the computer does not have an IR camera.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: Windows 10 Enterprise is not required for Windows Hello.  Windows Hello also works on Windows 10 Pro.<br>C: UEFI Secure Boot is not required for Windows Hello.<br>D: A virtual TPM driver is not required for Windows Hello.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-planning-guide

                                            1. Open File Explorer.<br>2. Browse and find the file or folder you want to have full access.<br>3. Right-click it, and select Properties.<br>4. Click the Security tab to access the NTFS permissions.<br>5. Click the Advanced button.<br>6. On the "Advanced Security Settings" page, you need to click the Change link, in the Owner's field.<br>7. Click the Advanced button.<br>8. On the "Select User or Group" page, click the Find Now button.<br>9. From the search result, select your user account, and click OK.<br>10.On the "Select User or Group" page, click OK.<br>11.Click Apply.<br>12.Click OK.<br>13.Click OK again.<br>14.Click OK one more time to complete this task.<br>It's important to note that if you're taking ownership of a folder, you can check the Replace ownership on subcontainers and object option in the Advanced<br>Security Settings page to take control of the subfolders inside of the folder.<br>Now you'll need to grant full access control to your account, to do this use the following steps:<br>1. Right-click the file or folder and select Properties.<br>2. Click the Security tab to access the NTFS permissions.<br>3. Click the Advanced button.<br>4. Under the Permissions tab, click Add.<br>5. Click Select a principal to add your user account.<br>6. On the "Select User or Group" page, click the Find Now button.<br>7. From the search result, select your user account, and click OK.<br>8.

On "Permission Entry", check the Full control option.<br>10.Click OK.<br>11.Click OK.<br>12.Click Apply.<br>13.Click OK.<br>14.Click OK to close the file or folder properties to complete the task.<br>You can now assign the necessary permissions to the Finance group.<br>If you right-click on a file or folder, choose Properties and click on the Security tab, we can now try to edit some permissions. Go ahead and click the Edit button to get started.<br>At this point, there are a couple of things you can do. Firstly, you'll notice that the Allow column is probably greyed out and can't be edited. This is because of the inheritance I was talking about earlier. However, you can check items on the Deny column.<br>When you click the Add button, you have to type in the user name or group name into the box and then click on Check Names to make sure it's correct. If you don't remember the user or group name, click on the Advanced button and then just click Find Now. It will show you all the users and groups.<br>Click OK and the user or group will be added to the access control list. Now you can check the Allow column or Deny column.<br>Reference:<br>https://www.windowscentral.com/how-take-ownership-files-and-folders-windows-10 https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/set-file-folder-permissions-windows/

This isn't specified in the question so it's likely that the question will be updated in future.<br>Password protected sharing is turned on on Computer1.  User3 does not have an account on Computer1 so User3 cannot access Share1 from Computer2.<br>However, the Guest account is enabled which could provide access depending on which version of Windows 10 is running.  If it is Windows 10 Home or Pro, then the answer to this question is Yes.  The Guest account does provide access.

                                            The command prompt will open in the user profile folder.  In the exhibit, USERPROFILE is C:\Users\User1.<br>PathExt is an Environment Variable that stores a list of the file extensions for operation system to execute. When running a command line that does not contain an extension, the system uses the value of this environment variable to determine which extensions to look for and in what order, such as .com first, follow by<br>.exe, .bat, .cmd, which happens to be the default value stored in the PathExt by Windows.<br>In the exhibit, PATHEXT shows that .exe comes before .bat and .cmd.

                                            The requirement states: Automate the configuration of the contractors' computers. The solution must provide a configuration file that the contractors can open from a Microsoft SharePoint site to apply the required configurations.<br>The 'configuration file' in this case is known as a 'provisioning package'.<br>A provisioning package (.ppkg) is a container for a collection of configuration settings. With Windows 10, you can create provisioning packages that let you quickly and efficiently configure a device without having to install a new image.<br>The tool for creating provisioning packages is renamed Windows Configuration Designer, replacing the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) tool.<br>References:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-install-icd https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-packages

The forest is synced to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). All the employees are assigned Microsoft 365 E3 licenses.<br>The domain contains a user account for an employee named User10.<br><br>Client Computers -<br>All the employees have computers that run Windows 10 Enterprise. All the computers are installed without Volume License Keys. Windows 10 license keys are never issued.<br>All the employees register their computer to Azure AD when they first receive the computer.<br>User10 has a computer named Computer10.<br>All the contractors have their own computer that runs Windows 10. None of the computers are joined to Azure AD.<br><br>Operational Procedures -<br>Fabrikam has the following operational procedures:<br> Updates are deployed by using Windows Update for Business.<br> When new contractors are hired, administrators must help the contactors configure the following settings on their computer:<br>- User certificates<br>- Browser security and proxy settings<br>- Wireless network connection settings<br><br>Security Policies -<br>The following security policies are enforced on all the client computers in the domain:<br> All the computers are encrypted by using BitLocker Drive Encryption (BitLocker). BitLocker recovery information is stored in Active Directory and Azure AD.<br> The local Administrators group on each computer contains an enabled account named LocalAdmin.<br> The LocalAdmin account is managed by using Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS).<br><br>Problem Statements -<br>Fabrikam identifies the following issues:<br> Employees in the finance department use an application named Application1. Application1 frequently crashes due to a memory error. When Application1 crashes, an event is written to the application log and an administrator runs a script to delete the temporary files and restart the application.<br> When employees attempt to connect to the network from their home computer, they often cannot establish a VPN connection because of misconfigured VPN settings.<br> An employee has a computer named Computer11. Computer11 has a hardware failure that prevents the computer from connecting to the network.<br> User10 reports that Computer10 is not activated.<br><br>Technical Requirements -<br>Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements for managing the client computers:<br> Provide employees with a configuration file to configure their VPN connection.<br> Use the minimum amount of administrative effort to implement the technical requirements.<br> Identify which employees' computers are noncompliant with the Windows Update baseline of the company.<br> Ensure that the service desk uses Quick Assist to take remote control of an employee's desktop during support calls.<br>Automate the configuration of the contractors' computers. The solution must provide a configuration file that the contractors can open from a Microsoft<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/04210/0004100014.png" class="in-exam-image" /><br>SharePoint site to apply the required configurations.
