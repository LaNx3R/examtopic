                                            You have an Azure subscription that contains a custom application named Application1. Application1 was developed by an external company named Fabrikam,<br>Ltd. Developers at Fabrikam were assigned role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to the Application1 components. All users are licensed for the<br>Microsoft 365 E5 plan.<br>You need to recommend a solution to verify whether the Fabrikam developers still require permissions to Application1. The solution must meet the following requirements:<br>✑ To the manager of the developers, send a monthly email message that lists the access permissions to Application1.<br>✑ If the manager does not verify an access permission, automatically revoke that permission.<br>✑ Minimize development effort.<br>What should you recommend?<br>

In contrast to queues, topics and subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication in a publish and subscribe pattern. It's useful for scaling to large numbers of recipients. Each published message is made available to each subscription registered with the topic. Publisher sends a message to a topic and one or more subscribers receive a copy of the message, depending on filter rules set on these subscriptions.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions

Currently, the script is run manually after approval from the operations manager.<br>You need to recommend a serverless solution that performs the following actions:<br>✑ Runs the script once an hour to identify whether duplicate files exist<br>✑ Sends an email notification to the operations manager requesting approval to delete the duplicate files<br>✑ Processes an email response from the operations manager specifying whether the deletion was approved<br>✑ Runs the script if the deletion was approved<br>What should you include in the recommendation?<br>

The child is associated with a firewall and applies configurations/rules from the parent policy and the child policy instantly to the firewall.<br>Reference:<br>https://aidanfinn.com/?p=22006

The credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.<br>App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region.<br>App1 has the following data requirements:<br> Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.<br> Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.<br>App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:<br> Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).<br> Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.<br> All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other connections must be directed to the West Europe region.<br>Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.<br><br>Requirements: App2 -<br>App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following file storage requirements:<br> Save files to an Azure Storage account.<br> Replicate files to an on-premises location.<br> Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.<br>You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.<br>Application Development Requirements<br>Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development process must meet the following requirements:<br> A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production.<br> After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version.<br> The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application.<br><br>Identity Requirements -<br>Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:<br> Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.<br>The solution must minimize development effort.<br><img src="/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0003200013.png" class="in-exam-image" /><br><br>Security Requirement -<br>All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.<br>Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The credentials must NOT be shared between services.

                                            Scenario: Security Requirement -<br>All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.<br>Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The credentials must NOT be shared between services.<br><br>Box 1: A service principal -<br>A service principal is a type of security principal that identifies an application or service, which is to say, a piece of code rather than a user or group. A service principal's object ID is known as its client ID and acts like its username. The service principal's client secret acts like its password.<br>Note: Authentication with Key Vault works in conjunction with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which is responsible for authenticating the identity of any given security principal.<br>A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service, or application that's requesting access to Azure resources.
